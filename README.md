# BuildStripper
Build Stripper gets the build pipeline to totally ignore select folders, and reverts back after.  
<br/><br/>
Version 1.0  Credits:

<br/><br/>
This file must be in an "Editor" folder (Unity/Assets/Editor) for example.
<br/>
Set buildStrippedServer bool to false, to disable auto version changing, which is meant for headless servers.
<br/>
This script should drastically lower your build size, and optimise your game;  
<br/>
Build sizes differences in an example project:<br/>
Regular server build: 1 GB<br/>
An un-named Asset store plugin: 200 MB<br/>
This BuildStripper: 60mb<br/>

<br/><br/>
Optional Unity Menu buttons, for manually calling, just un-comment them in the script.<br/>
<br/><br/>

Please be aware this is version 1, an Alpha/Beta, code needs to be optimised and tidied up.
Enjoy!  ^_^
